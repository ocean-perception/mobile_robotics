We will begin to go through the main body of code that you will be using thoughout your project. It is highly suggested to install VS code, (a code editor like spyder and Jupyter Notebook), as it will show all the python files that you need to work with on the side.\nInstall VSCode  Both the Land Rover and the Robotic vessel will use the same code. Depending on your robot, you will need to configure it in the \u0026ldquo;configuration.yaml\u0026rdquo; file.\nThe installation will take you to a github repository. To install, click on the code button then install the code by clicking the \u0026lsquo;download zip\u0026rsquo; in the dropdown menu\n "},{"id":3,"href":"/mobile_robotics/intelligent_mobile_robotics/","title":"Intelligent mobile robotics","section":"Welcome to mobile robotics","content":"Intelligent mobile robotics #  Placeholder\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/mobile_robotics/maritime_robotics/","title":"Maritime robotics","section":"Welcome to mobile robotics","content":"Maritime robotics #  Placeholder\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/mobile_robotics/pi_configuration/","title":"pi_configuration","section":"Welcome to mobile robotics","content":"Chrony Configuration #  Chrony is an implementation of NTP, it allows for the pi\u0026rsquo;s to synchronize their time even if internet is not connected to one of them.
