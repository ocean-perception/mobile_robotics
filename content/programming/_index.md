# Setting Up 

Now that you have tested that the robot functions correctly. We will begin to go through the main body of code that you will be using thoughout your project. 
It is highly suggested to install VS code, (a code editor like spyder and Jupyter Notebook), as it will show all the python files that you need to work with on the side.

Both the Land Rover and the Robotic vessel will use the same code. Depending on your robot, you will need to configure it in the "configuration.yaml" file.

The installation will take you to a github repository. To install, click on the code button then install the code by clicking the 'download zip' in the dropdown menu
