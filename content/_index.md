## What is this module about?
Est in vagis et Pittheus tu arge accipiter regia iram vocatur nurus. Omnes ut
olivae sensit **arma sorori** deducit, inesset **crudus**, ego vetuere aliis,
modo arsit? Utinam rapta fiducia valuere litora _adicit cursu_, ad facies

## What requirement are needed?
Ea _furtique_ risere fratres edidit terrae magis. Colla tam mihi tenebat:
miseram excita suadent es pecudes iam. Concilio _quam_ velatus posset ait quod
nunc! Fragosis suae dextra geruntur functus vulgata.

## What will you be able to do after you finish it?
Lorem **markdownum** emicat gestu. Cannis sol pressit ducta. **Est** Idaei,
tremens ausim se tutaeque, illi ulnis hausit, sed, lumina cutem. Quae avis
sequens!

## Your Robot Layout

Click on the side-bar for more information on your specific robot. Depending on your course, you will be using 1 of 3 possible robots: 

{{< columns >}}
### Robotic Vessel

The Robotic Vessel will consist of a kit with the vessel components, electronic components and the Rasberry pi with a pihat installed. The kit will be able to orient its posisitoning with motor movement and remote localisation.

<--->

### Pitop Rover

The Pitop Rover consists of an assembly kit and a rasberry pi with Pitop's version of linux installed. The kit should be straight forward to assemble. Libraries for odometry and motor movement are pre-installed on the Pitops. [Assembly tutorial](https://www.pi-top.com/start/pi-top-4) will show you how to install the Pi inside the Pitop. Remember that the Pitop needs a minimum of 36 watts to be able to charge.

<--->

### Thymio Rover 

The Thymio Rover uses a Rasberry Pi 3. It also uses a ROS as a midware in order to bridge communication between the rasberry pi and the motors, unfortunately it does not contain encoders and therefore will necessitate a stronger emphasis on the lidar sensor provided. The kit will come fully assmbled.

## Where to start?

Once Everything is succesfully assembled, (follow the assembly page), you may start exploring the programming page. If the pi has not yet been pre-configured with the correct libraries, look at the 'configure pi' page and ask a professor for help.
