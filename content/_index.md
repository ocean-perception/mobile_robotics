# Welcome


## What is this module about?
This module introduces the theoretical and practical design of robotic systems such as autonomous robots, underwater and surface vehicles (AUVs, ASVs).

You will be introduced to the theoretical principles underlying their design including aspects of guidance, navigation and control, modelling and simulation. The module aims to provide you with the skills required to design, build and deploy simple robotic systems.


## What will you be able to do after you finish it?
Design, develop and build, as a team, a demonstrator robotic system for testing and evaluation. (Contributing to EAB accreditation LOs: D8, D11, P3, G1, G4, P12)

## Your Robot Layout
Click on the side-bar for more information on your specific robot. Depending on your course, you will be using 1 of 3 possible robots:

### Robotic Vessel

The Robotic Vessel will consist of a kit with the vessel components, electronic components and the Raspberry pi with a pi-hat installed. The kit will be able to orient its posisitioning with motor movement and remote localisation.

<--->

### Pitop Rover

The Pitop Rover consists of an rover kit with a raspberry pi with Pitop's version of linux installed. Libraries for odometry and motor movement are pre-installed on the Pitops. [Assembly tutorial](https://www.pi-top.com/start/pi-top-4) will show you how to install the Pi inside the Pitop. Remember that the Pitop needs a minimum of 36 watts to be able to charge.

<--->

### Thymio Rover

The Thymio Rover uses a Raspberry Pi 3. It also uses a ROS as a midware in order to bridge communication between the raspberry pi and the motors, unfortunately it does not contain encoders and therefore will necessitate a stronger emphasis on the lidar sensor provided. The kit will come fully assembled.

## Where to start?

Once Everything is successfully assembled, (follow the assembly page), you may start exploring the **programming** page. If the pi has not yet been pre-configured with the correct libraries, look at the *'configure pi'* page and ask a professor for help.
