# FABRICATION


## PROCESS
It is recommended to go through the steps without gluing anything first to familiarise yourself).
To form one float: 
 
1. Following the cement instructions, form two “C”s made up of two 90° bends and a 5.5cm tube each. The glue dries fairly quickly, make sure the bends are aligned using the fabrication lines on the plastic.
2. Grab one of the “C”s and weld one 40cm tube. You should now have something that resembles an “L” shape.
3. Connect the one 16.5cm tube and one 17.5cm tube to the equal tee according to the following diagram (pay attention to the curve in the Tee being closer to the longer piece of tubing).
 
4. Glue the end of the 17.5cm tube to the empty 90° bend in the “L” assembly from step 2. At this point, your assembly should have a “U” shape.
5. Using the second “C” from step above, close the assembly by gluing the 40cm tube and 16.5cm to the empty 90° bends.
6. Leave to dry and repeat steps 1-5 to form the second float.
To form the centre piece:
 
1. Grab the 25cm tube and mark 5cm from one end.
2. Place 3 pipe clips at one end, aligning the one closest to the end with the mark above. Make sure the pipe clips are aligned with each other and draw a line across the top of them and the tube (this will make alignment easier after the glue is applied).
3. Rotate the middle clip by 180 degrees and mark the tube on the opposite side.
4. One by one, apply glue to the tube and the inside of each pipe clip and weld them together. Leave to dry for 10min.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for the other end, making sure that the clips are aligned with the previous ones as well.

Let’s start by assembling the structure of the marine platform.
1. Grab the two floats and remove the screw caps from each tee and their washers.
2. At either end of the centre piece, insert the screw caps, the plastic washer and finally the black rubber washer (in that order). Make sure the inclined edge of the rubber washer faces towards the end of the tubing.
3. Connect the floats to the centre piece by screwing the caps to the tees. Ensure it is fully tightened as this will prevent water from entering and the rotation of the floats.
4. The structure is now ready!
Continue by assembling the motors:
1. Start by attaching one lower bracket (3D Printed) to the pipe clips of the centre piece as illustrated below. Remember to put a washer at either side of the part!
 
2. Grab the motor pillar (3D Printed) and position the motor in the cross socket. Proceed to attach one end of the coupler.
 
3. Take the propeller shaft provided and trim it to 94mm from the threaded end.
4. Press fit a bearing at the end of the motor cone (3D Printed), you can heat it slightly to locally melt the plastic if necessary.
5. Connect the end of the shaft to the coupler
 
6. Fit the shaft through the bearing and screw the propeller in (Make sure it is the correct propeller for the motor side you are assembling, they will spin in opposite directions). If you find the propeller coming loose during tests, consider super gluing it in place after you are sure they spin in the right direction.
7. You can now attach the motor cone, motor pillar and motor dome together. Insert three M4 – 30mm bolts with their respective washers through the dome first as shown below:
 
8. Now attach the motor assembly above to the lower bracket, do not forget the washer at either end of the M4 – 30mm bolts.
 
9. You have now finished mounting one motor, please repeat steps 1-8 to mount the second one.
Let’s now prepare the control box, for reference of where to place the components, please have a look at the following image:
 
10. Carry out the connections according to the diagram below:
